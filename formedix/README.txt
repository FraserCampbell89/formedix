# Formedix tech test

This tech test uses the Flickr API to pull in images and create an infinite scroll lazy load to pull more results.

## Running

cd into the folder and start a local server.

```bash
cd ...path_to_where_folder_is_kept.../formedix
php -S localhost:2222
```
Open browser and enter localhost:2222 into the address bar.

Enter image search query.

### Plugins

I have used Magnific Popup (https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/) to handle the popup of the gallery functionality. I have used this before for handling similar situations, it is very fexible and handles most situations.
